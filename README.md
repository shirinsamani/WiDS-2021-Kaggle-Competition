# WiDS-2021-Kaggle-Competition
Women in Data Science (WiDs) held a competition on March 2021 focused on patient health with emphasis on the chronic condition of diabetes. The data is accessible on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021). 
This repo includes my codes to build a ML model to predict chance of having diabetes.
